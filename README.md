# TODO List Application
This project involves building a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Todo List application where users can manage their tasks. The application will allow users to register, log in, and manage their list of todos by creating, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks. Additionally, users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
